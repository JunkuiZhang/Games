## 0. Introduction

Auto-generaete 600 fields each given a random number from 0 to 1 followed the normal distribution. The number stands for the field's produnciton. Each entity aotu-seek for a high productive field to stay there. Entityies' cost to "live" is ascending with time grows with a initial threshold 60.

## 1. Reference

- [Gini index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gini_coefficient)

$$Delta = sum_{j=1}^n sum_{j=1}^n frac{|X_j - X_i|}{n^2}$$
    
    Then, the Gini index will be the following

$$G = frac{Delta}{2u}$$
    
    where u is defined by \\(u = frac{1}{n} sum_{i=1}^n X_i\\)
